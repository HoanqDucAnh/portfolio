					My journey with steak started humbly - a bit comically even. My early
					attempts were, let’s say, less than perfect. As Mom described, they
					were burnt, under-seasoned, and rubbery. <br />
					<i>Tenaciously</i>, I threw myself into mastering the art of cooking
					steak. <br />
					After countless attempts, testing every little detail: the pan
					temperature, the timing, the seasoning, basting it with butter and
					fresh herbs, I finally nailed it: a perfectly seared, medium-rare,
					dry-aged ribeye, basted in rosemary-thyme butter that was tender,
					juicy, and packed with flavor.
					<br />
					The dish became a symbol of my dedication and growth as a cook, and
					the commitment I bring to my culinary creations.

					Simple but delicious, this dish is all about bringing out the natural

					I pile on some mushrooms sautéed in garlic—those mushrooms soak up all

					Spaghetti Bolognese is one of those dishes that I find myself
